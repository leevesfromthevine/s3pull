This is a script based off of Ian Horn's Juypter Notebook examples using KyFromAbove's s3 bucket: https://github.com/ianhorn/kyfromabove-on-aws-examples.

s3 buckets can be found in constants.py in Ian Horn's example project.

Before using remove the placeholder ./aoi_raster/rasters.txt and ./aoi_shp/shp.txt files.
