This is a script based off of Ian Horn's Juypter Notebook examples using KyFromAbove's s3 bucket: https://github.com/ianhorn/kyfromabove-on-aws-examples

If you see this and have any reccomendations for alternatives to qgisforthreejs or the qgis DEMto3D plugin shoot me an email at siobhan@leevesfromthevine.com.

TODO ->
Add mosaic process.
Add DEM 3D visualization process.
Look into replacing GeoPandas usage with Rasterio's native s3 I/O.
